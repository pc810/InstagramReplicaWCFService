# Instagram Replica using WCF Service.

This project is made to provide basic functionality
of instagram i.e. users can create their accounts, post photos and
comments on different posts. User can also follow other users and
like/dislike-e the posts. The basic application is made using the Windows
Form Application. The business logic is compartmentalized into different
services which are essentially WCF services which are hosted on a host
application and the proxy of the host is used whenever any operation is
to be called from the original application.
